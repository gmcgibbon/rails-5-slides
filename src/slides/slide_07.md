Vertical:

## ActionCable

Support for WebSockets with Rails. Allows us to push data to users in real-time.

Vertical:

## API Mode

Support for API-only Rails apps. Allows us to build fast JSON APIs with `rails new app --api`.

Vertical:

## ActiveRecord OR

Support for *simple* OR queries in ActiveRecord. Allows us to write `SQL OR` queries without third-party plugins or ugly workarounds.

Vertical:

## (5.1) Better JS Management

Support for `webpack` with Rails. Allows us to use `webpack` and `yarn` instead of `sprockets` to manage JavaScript.
